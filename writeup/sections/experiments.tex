We will now emperically validate that the hierarchical implementation is more time efficient than the standard implementation without sacrificying accuracy.
Three experiments will be conducted.

First, we will \textbf{measure elapsed time as insertions scale} of each implementation.
We anticpate that the hierarchical implementation will take less time than the standard implementation for any sufficiently large value of insertions.

Second, we will \textbf{measure false positives as we scale bits allocated per element} of each implementation.
We anticipate that the hierarchial and standard implementation will be approximately same as the theoerical false positive rate discussed before.

Third, we will \textbf{measure throughput as insertions scale with a fixed bitarray size.}
The primary intention of this experiment is to explore the hierarchial implementation's efficiency for small bitarray sizes.
We do not anticipate the hierarchial implementation to outperform the standard implementation for bitarray's of less than one page size.

For each of these sections, we pseudorandomly generate keys to both insert and query.
Discussion on exactly how these keys are generated is discussed in the appendix.

\subsection{Comparing Time Efficiency}

For this experiment, we seek to validate that the hierarchical implementation performs better than the standard implementation as the number of insertions grow.
\textit{Hypothesis:} The hierarchial bloom filter will take less time than the standard implementation to insert $n$ keys for any $n$.

\subsubsection{Experimental Settings}

The experiment will run as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate $n$ random keys.
    \item Generate a bloom filter of both varianets of size $10n$. Use the optimal theoeretical configuraiton for each bloom filter (i.e, $k=7$, $l=1$).
    \item Time how long it takes to insert all $n$ keys into each of the bloom filters.
    \item Repeat for various sizes of $n$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Results}
\begin{center}

The slope of the line of best fits that are plotted are as follows whre $n$ is millions of insertions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The best fit line for the standard implementation is: $t = 1.07146\cdot n - 5.83917$
    \item The best fit line for the hierarchical implementation is: $t = 0.789073\cdot n -3.64732 $
\end{itemize}
Thus, our experiment shows that the hierarchical implementation performs $35\%$ more operations per second than the standard implementation!

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
We have supported our hypothesis that the hierarchical implementation is more efficient than the standard implementation. In fact, it can perform $35\%$ more operations per second.
