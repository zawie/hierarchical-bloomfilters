In this paper, we have theoretically and emperically justified a variant implementation of bloom filters
that lead to much higher performance without increasing the false positive rate.
We anaylzed the expected number of unique pages accessed per query, which should coorelate with expected number of page faults, and found that our implementation is expected to page fault less.
Moreover, we found a closed form expression of the false positive rate of our implementaiton and found that it was equivalent to the standard implementation's false positive rate.
Additionally, we performed two experiments with randomly generated keys to emperically back these claims.
Lastly, we compared the standard and hierarchical implementation on a real data set.
Our findings were positive: our implementation is more efficient than the standard implementation while maintaing the same false positive rate.
