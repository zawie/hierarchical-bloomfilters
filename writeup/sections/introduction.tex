In this section I will describe the proposed hierarchial blooom filter implementaiton in detail.

Our hierarchial bloom filter will be a collection of bloom filters of the computer systems page size (4096 bytes).
We will have as many bloom filters as it takes to occupy $M$ bits. $M$ sohuld be $10N$ where $N$ is the number of expected keys to be in the bloom filter.
We will generate $8$ independent hash functions. 1 hash function will be used to select the sub-bloom filter; the other $7$ will be used to set bits in the baby bloom filter as the standard implementation.

The idea behind this is that we minimize page faults, as we only need to access one page of memory to set bits instead of up to $7$.

The numbers selected will be justified in the \textit{Theoretical Justification} section.
