Bloom filters \cite{Bloom} are used ubiquitously due to their speed and memory efficiency in theory and in practice.
However, the standard implementation of sufficiently large bloom filters suffers from page faults.
In this paper we propose a bloom filter implementation that guarantees one page access per operation. 
This minimizes page faults, thereby drasticaly improving efficiency.
We will show theoretically and empirically that our hierarchical implementation is expected to be faster than the standard implementation without alterating the false positive rate.
