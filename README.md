# 🌸 Hierarchical Bloomfilters
This was a research project for a graduate level course at Rice University: COMP 580, probabilistic data structures and algorithms.

## 🚀 How to run
Simply run `make run_fast` for a quick execution of all the tests. These are not the settings used in the final report, but are used to validate the functionaltiy of the scripts.
To generate data used in the reportm run `make run_full`. Both of these commands will generate .dat files in `./experiments/dats` and plots in `./plots`.
Note, only one of each plot will be preserved, while the `.dats` will be preserved until deleted.
